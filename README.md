# Hacker News Clone

A web application developed in React.js that serves as a clone of the Hacker News website. The project contains two main pages: "New Stories" and "Top Stories". The application fetches story data from the Hacker News API to display on these pages. Additionally, static login interfaces are provided on the pages, but they are not functional in this version of the project.
